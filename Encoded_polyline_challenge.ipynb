    "Faced alot of issue with the Encoded polylines. These polylines will contain \"\\\\\" and Python treat it them escape character, which mean when I try to save it in dataframe or in any form all the \"\\\\\" will get replaced with \"\\\". This is a huge problem, becuase this changes the entire meaning and decoded coordinates of the encoded string. The encoded geometry should be as it is received from the API otherwise the further analysis will not be accurate. This Geometry will act as input for other APIs\n",
